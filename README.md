# Baloot AI

An interactive tool that computes the optimal card play in the Saudi card game **Baloot** using **Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning**, simulating all possible futures to determine the best possible outcome for each team.

The project includes:

- **Streamlit App** â€“ An interactive frontend to input current player hands and simulate the optimal sequence of moves.
- **Minimax Backend** â€“ A complete implementation of the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to efficiently compute the best possible play sequence.
- **Archived MCTS Notebook** â€“ An early exploration using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with UCB1 and rollouts before transitioning to minimax.
