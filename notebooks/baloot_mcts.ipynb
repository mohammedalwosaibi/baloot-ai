    "# Archived: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook documents my initial attempt to solve Baloot using **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** with **UCB1 scoring** and **random rollouts** to estimate the best average move at each game state. The algorithm simulates thousands of possible futures to make decisions based on expected outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this method was effective for early experimentation, I eventually transitioned to a more deterministic and optimal solution using **Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning**, which better suits the perfect information, zero-randomness nature of Baloot. That final approach is implemented in the main application.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is preserved here for reference and historical insight into the projectâ€™s development."
